# Hangman!

#### (No men are hung in this game)

This is a simple command line version of the game hangman. This game features a save and load feature.

## Things I Learned:

- Learned about serialization and how to use it in a simple game
- Gained a better grasp on OOP and how to better implement classes/ class variables
- Developed a better understanding of flow in my game's pacing
- Found more areas to improve my use of logic or Ruby specific syntax

## Things I Would Like To Improve:

- Definitely want to learn more about serialiazation and how to best use it.
- Want to learn how to better refactor my code into a less verbose, more concise structure
- Would like to look into options to improve user feedback (ie. printing an actual hangman)
